title: Upshire
slug: upshire
excerpt: This walk goes through sections of Epping Forest, Warlies Park, and Copped Hall Park, sometimes on open access land. This means that parts of the route do not follow official footpaths. The terrain is hilly, and there is a mix of open meadow and ancient woodland. You have to cross and re-cross the M25 (bridges are provided!) which is noisy and dusty but within a few yards either side of this you are in the heart of rural Essex.

### Getting there

Parking: In a layby along the northern side of Crown Hill, Upshire, EN9 3SZ

### Directions

1. The parking consists of a long layby on the northern side of Crown Hill,
   opposite the Good Intent in Copthall Green.

2. Walk along the grass beside the road heading uphill. Look for a metal vehicle
   barrier and, ignoring the footpath signpost, follow a track leading from the
   barrier into some trees.

3. When you emerge from the trees 40 yards later, walk northwards along the
   edge of a meadow with a hedge on your right, for about 250 yards. Bear left
   across the meadow along a poorly defined path heading due north towards a
   telegraph pole.

4. Look for a small path twisting through the narrow woods opposite. This path
   should take you onto a minor road (Long Street) near the point where the road
   forks. If you can't see the junction you've come through the narrow woods
   at an unexpected place! No worries, if there are posh houses opposite then
   you're too far south and need to turn right along the road: if there's no houses
   then you're too far north and need to turn left.

5. From the junction, take the left fork and walk northwards along the road with
   trees on either side for 400 yards. Just before the entrance to Nicholls Farm turn
   left along a footpath.

6. The footpath takes you gently downhill through some beautiful woods. After
   about 380 yards you might be able to see Queen Boadicea's Obelisk in the field
   on your right. The Obelisk was built in the early 18th century at the place where
   she was believed to have died after her Iceni warriors were finally defeated by
   the Romans at nearby Ambresbury Banks in Epping Forest. Continue through
   the woods for a further 220 yards to the roadside and turn right past Obelisk
   Farm.

7. Walk along the lane for 50 yards. You will pass a wooden 5 bar gate on your
   left. 15 yards later go into Warlies Park via a pedestrian entrance set back from
   the road, near a telegraph pole. You should see a Corporation of London sign by
   the entrance gate.

8. Once through the entrance gate turn left through a hedge gap and walk up a
   hill towards the Temple, built in the early 18th century out of Portland stone.
   You won't see a footpath up the hill; Warlies Park is mostly open access and you
   can take any route you choose.

9. At the Temple turn right and go back down the hill heading westwards. Go
   through a field entrance, then bear slightly left to walk up the hill opposite
   heading southwest past some fenced young trees. As you walk up the hill you
   can see Warlies Park House in the valley to your right. Near the top of the hill,
   just past a copse of mature trees, there is an exit gate. Go through this, up
   the slope then through a car park, to the roadside.

10. At the roadside turn right towards The Horseshoes. Cross the road and take
    Footpath 54 adjacent to the pub heading south.

11. Continue south through a field with a hedge on your left for 300 yards. At the
    bottom of the hill cross a footbridge and 15 yards later, turn left along a
    bridleway (called Sergeants Green Lane).

12. Walk along the bridleway east for 140 yards then follow the path round to the
    right at a T-junction. Walk south (along Blind Lane) for 240 yards, then at
    another T-junction, turn left to walk uphill with Potkiln Wood on your right.

13. This green lane is known as Green Lane. Continue along Green Lane for about 500 yards. After a few yards you will
    have an open field on your left and at some point you will probably start to hear
    the M25. When you reach another T-junction (at the entrance to the Woodredon
    Estate) turn right to cross the motorway bridge.

14. On the far side follow the winding track ahead. You will pass Green Lane
    Bungalows on your left, then 50 yards later the track turns to the right. Leave
    the stony track and go straight on eastwards along a tree-lined unsurfaced path
    through some trees.

15. 400 yards later the path kinks slightly left, then bears right to continue as a
    narrower path, still with trees on either side.

16. Continue along this path heading southeast for a further 300 yards, until you
    find yourself going up a fairly steep slope into Epping Forest. Epping Forest is
    open access, which means you don't have to stick to footpaths but can walk
    anywhere. Any paths which do exist are poorly defined because there is little
    undergrowth in this part of the Forest. As best as you can, continue straight on
    walking south east. Look out for some bridleway markers (consisting of a post
    marked with a horseshoe shape) and follow these south east for about 400
    yards.

17. When you reach a reddish beaten earth track, turn left along the track until you pass between some wooden posts onto the old Lodge Road (now
    closed).

18. (If you reach Epping Road, the B1393, you've somehow missed the reddish
    track. Look for a bus stop in a layby adjacent to a closed road which is now an
    Emergency Access point into the forest. The closed road is the old Lodge Road.)
    S. Turn left (north) along the old Lodge Road. After 50 yards you will pass a car
    park on your left, after which the road surface disappears and the route
    becomes a forest path.

19. Walk northwards along this path for 600 yards. When you reach the roadside
    (Crown Hill) you will see the magnificent lodges and entrance gates to Copped
    Hall, on the opposite side of the road. Cross the road and go through the side
    gate on the left, which is on a public footpath and is left unlocked for walkers.

20. Much of the remainder of this walk is within Copped Hall Park. This is a
    sensitive area for wildlife. Please keep dogs on leads at all times and respect any
    seasonal restrictions or diversions during key breeding seasons, which will be
    clearly signed.

21. Continue northwards along the driveway for another 400 yards to the M25
    bridge, then carry on over the bridge and along the driveway for a further 200
    yards, with some woods on your left. When the woods end (just before the track
    you were following bears right) turn left to skirt the woods.

22. 120 yards later, when the woods stop, go through the facing hedge and turn
    right to walk north along a field edge with the hedge on your right for 40 yards.

23. Go through a gap in the facing hedge then bear left along a farm track. Walk
    over the crest of the hill and down the other side, past a small strip of woodland
    known as the Selvage. As you descend, there are good views of the ruins
    of Copped Hall.

24. At the bottom of the hill go through a metal gate. 40 yards later turn left
    along a lane, and 150 yards further on go straight on past another gate beside a
    pretty cottage.

25. Bear left a few yards later to walk southwest along a track. Roughly 300
    yards after this is the fork you first encountered in paragraph 4. Look for the
    gap in the hedge you emerged from early in the walk, and retrace your steps back to Upshire
