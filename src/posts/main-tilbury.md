excerpt: This walk begins near East Tilbury Rail Station, and heads east along the outskirtsof the town, then across the marshes before heading south along the riverside to the Coalhouse Fort. From there it goes west over farmland, then north and east back to the town. The glory of this walk is the contrast between the local industrial and architectural heritage, and the eternal stillness of the marshlands themselves. From the constant movement at the Mucking Landfill site, the magnificent towers of the Coryton Oil Refinery, the busy river traffic, the ancient and modern sea defences, the fort itself, the distant views of Cliffe Fort opposite, and the sad dilapidation of the Bata factory, the history of this part of coastal Essex is played out before your eyes.

### Getting there

Parking: In Princess Margaret Road, on the pavement on the left, RM18 8SB.

### Directions

1. From the parking (P), head north up towards the station and turn right on the
   footpath alongside Gobions Park, going through a kissing gate onto the grassy
   track that runs between the playing fields and the houses.

2. At the end of the houses, the track bends left then right around a small copse
   before continuing east through a shrubby area. After crossing a small stream
   the track turns right in front of the landfill site boundary fence.

3. The path continues southwards between the fence and the stream for about
   400 yards before bearing left. From this point on you begin to get good views
   across the marshes to the sea wall. Continue heading east until you reach the sea
   wall.

4. Cross the sea wall using the ladder provided (or there is an easier crossing
   point about 50 yards to the left of the ladder) and take in the views across the
   mud flats to Coryton oil refinery. Despite the industrialisation of this part of the
   coast, the mud flats are an important resource for indigenous and migratory birds.

5. Turn right, away from the oil refinery, and walk along the sea wall. You
   have wonderful views of the mud flats to your left, the busy Thames, and the hills
   of Kent in the distance.

6. After about a mile the sea wall turns inland leaving a larger marshy area
   between the wall and the river. Stay on the sea wall.

7. Head straight across over the ramp continuing on the sea wall until you come
   to the grounds of the Coalhouse Fort itself. The grounds are open and you can
   walk through as you choose: we took the path on the mowed grass inside the
   lake, where there is often a good view of freighters moving up and down the
   Thames.

8. Head back north up the road until you come to St Catherine's Church.
   Opposite the church is public footpath 200 heading west across a field.

9. Follow this path until you come to a slight rise, where the footpath is crossed by
   a farmtrack. Go straight across the farmtrack, heading slightly downhill towards a
   tall concrete wall you can see in the distance. The terrain is more overgrown
   here although the path is still clear.
   From here until you reach Station Road, the signage is either missing or
   plain confusing. It is also impossible to follow the exact route of the Ordnance
   Survey marked footpath due to overgrowth. Follow these instructions and you'll
   find the way through.

10. Just before you reach the wall the path turns right up the slope, circuiting the
    end of the wall and then descends back down onto valley floor. After about
    50 yards the valley opens out into a field traversed by telegraph poles: this is
    roughly level with the marshland on the edge of the estuary. Follow the southern
    field edge on the left.

11. At the far bottom corner of the field is a gap in the hedge and a ditch. Cross
    the ditch and you will find a well maintained path between hedges.

12. Continue along this for about half a mile until you come to a farm track. Bear right into the shrubbery to find another grassy path between hedges, parallel
    with the farm track heading north west. This rejoins the official public footpath and
    emerges back onto the farm track by some metal gates. Go around the gates
    on the right hand side and continue on the track until it meets the corner of the
    main road (Station Road).
13. On the road, carry straight on for about a quarter of a mile to the junction with
    Love Lane. Just before this junction there is a bridleway (No. 58) on the left,
    adjacent to a house: follow this.

14. This bridleway starts off as a green lane called Coal Road then becomes field
    side track: follow the signs across a field and then along the field edge with the
    hedge on your left, until you come to the level crossing. You will see the
    abandoned Bata factory on the right, and Tilbury Power Station on the left.

15. Once across the railway line, follow the bridleway signs across the field towards
    the electricity pylons. As you go under the second line of wires you will pass right
    by the pylon. The bridleway turns left here but there is a permissive path straight
    on (north) towards a small hedge, with a white house in the distance; take this.

16. When you reach the start of the hedge turn right on FP 61, going under the
    overhead power lines, following the line between two fields towards a gap
    between the houses.

17. This gap takes you into Beechroft Avenue: cross the road and bear right into
    Stenning Avenue and continue until you see an alleyway on your right which
    takes you to East Tilbury Station entrance. Turn left away from the station to the
    automated crossing gates on Princess Margaret Road, cross over the crossing and head back south to the parking
