slug: bocking
excerpt: This is a simple, gentle walk through open farmland in the heart of Essex. The paths are clearly marked and well defined, and for most of the route you will be walking along well drained farm tracks wide enough for two people to walk side by side. The route is fairly flat although there are still some nice views to be enjoyed and the countryside feels blissfully remote and quiet. Bocking Churchstreet itself is lovely with a grand church, some elegant Victorian houses and many historic buildings dating from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

### Getting there

Parking: Outside St Mary's Church Hall, Bocking


### Directions

1. From the car park, go north through some imposing gates into the
   grounds of Bocking Hall. Walk up the drive and turn right immediately past a fish
   pond to walk along a narrow path leading into a field.

2. Go straight on across the field until you approach a small lane (Fennes
   Road).

3. A couple of yards before the lane bear left to pass between the trees into
   another field. There are plans to turn this sloping field into a wildflower meadow.

4. Walk diagonally up this field towards the north west corner. There is a
   concrete track running along the top. Bear left along this track heading north
   west.

5. After 300 yards you will see a small triangular copse to the right of the track.
   Turn right in front of the copse, leaving the concrete track and walking along a
   grassy path along the field edge.

6. Continue along this grassy path heading north for a little over half a mile, until
   hedge line curves slightly to the left. Follow the hedge round and walk along the
   wide grassy green lane you will see leading north from the corner of the field.

7. Continue along the lane to a T-junction. Turn left then right along a stony
   farm track, passing an open barn on your left (7).
8. Just past the barn you will come to the edge of a field. Turn right to walk
   around the field edge.

9. Continue around the edge of the field keeping the trees on your right until you
   come to the end of the woods. Turn right along a stony track.

10. Walk along this track alongside Bovingdon Wood for a quarter of a mile. The
    large wooded area ahead of you is Parkhall Wood. Where the woods meet, bear
    right along the track to pass between them.

11. Stay on the stony track beside Bovingdon Wood for 250 yards then continue
    ahead along the track with a hedge on your left. When you reach the facing
    hedge go through a gap and turn right along the bridleway.

12. Keep going along this path through Shoulder of Mutton Wood then along a
    lovely green lane to a T-junction. Turn left past an uncomfortable looking seat and walk along the lane heading eastwards.

13. After 300 yards, continue eastwards over a staggered junction with the hedge
    on your left. Keep going until the track peters out. There is a hedge in front of
    you. Fork left to walk ahead with the hedge now on your right.

14. Continue eastwards along the field edge for a further 300 yards then follow
    the hedge line sharply round to the right then to the left.

15. As you reach the edge of the woods you will see a narrow enclosed path
    ahead of you. Walk south east along this until you come to the road.

16. Turn right along the road (High Garrett) and look for a footpath on the right
    140 yards later opposite the MDS engineering works. The Hare and Hounds is
    about 125 yards further on down the road.

17. Turn right along the footpath and walk ahead along the field edge. Go through a gap in the facing hedge then turn right to walk around the field. Keep
    going until you are opposite the entrance point, then look for a wide gap in the
    hedge on the right with a farm track on the far side.

18. Walk along this track for 500 yards passing the steep grassy slope around the
    Hill and Black fishing lake on your left, then turn left beside a small parking area,
    still with the fishery on your left.

19. Walk south along an enclosed path, then along a field edge, then along a narrow path with trees either side. Go straight on over a footbridge and
    continue ahead into Bocking Churchstreet.

20. Turn right on Church Street and walk down the hill To get a good
    sighting of Bocking Windmill take the enclosed footpath about 200 yards later on
    the left side of the road (beside some bungalows set back from the road), and
    follow it out into the fields.

21. Carry on down Church Street passing the Rose and Crown on the left. Better
    yet, go in. It's a lovely, unspoiled pub with a glorious beer garden, open all day
    and well worth a visit.

22. Continue down the road past The Retreat to the parki
